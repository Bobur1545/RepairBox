# V1 Tender

A tender represents a discrete monetary exchange. Square represents this
exchange as a money object with a specific currency and amount, where the
amount is given in the smallest denomination of the given currency.

Square POS can accept more than one form of tender for a single payment (such
as by splitting a bill between a credit card and a gift card). The `tender`
field of the Payment object lists all forms of tender used for the payment.

Split tender payments behave slightly differently from single tender payments:

The receipt_url for a split tender corresponds only to the first tender listed
in the tender field. To get the receipt URLs for the remaining tenders, use
the receipt_url fields of the corresponding Tender objects.

*A note on gift cards**: when a customer purchases a Square gift card from a
merchant, the merchant receives the full amount of the gift card in the
associated payment.

When that gift card is used as a tender, the balance of the gift card is
reduced and the merchant receives no funds. A `Tender` object with a type of
`SQUARE_GIFT_CARD` indicates a gift card was used for some or all of the
associated payment.
