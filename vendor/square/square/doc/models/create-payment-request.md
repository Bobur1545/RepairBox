## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description | Getter | Setter |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sourceId` | `string` | Required | The ID for the source of funds for this payment. This can be a payment token<br>(card nonce) generated by the Square payment form or a card on file made with the<br>Customers API. If recording a payment that the seller<br>received outside of Square, specify either "CASH" or "EXTERNAL".<br>For more information, see<br>[Take Payments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments).<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1` | getSourceId(): string | setSourceId(string sourceId): void |
| `idempotencyKey` | `string` | Required | A unique string that identifies this `CreatePayment` request. Keys can be any valid string<br>but must be unique for every `CreatePayment` request.<br><br>Max: 45 characters<br><br>Note: The number of allowed characters might be less than the stated maximum, if multi-byte<br>characters are used.<br><br>For more information, see [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/working-with-apis/idempotency).<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1`, *Maximum Length*: `45` | getIdempotencyKey(): string | setIdempotencyKey(string idempotencyKey): void |
| `amountMoney` | [`Money`](/doc/models/money.md) | Required | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. | getAmountMoney(): Money | setAmountMoney(Money amountMoney): void |
| `tipMoney` | [`?Money`](/doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. | getTipMoney(): ?Money | setTipMoney(?Money tipMoney): void |
| `appFeeMoney` | [`?Money`](/doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. | getAppFeeMoney(): ?Money | setAppFeeMoney(?Money appFeeMoney): void |
| `delayDuration` | `?string` | Optional | The duration of time after the payment's creation when Square automatically cancels the<br>payment. This automatic cancellation applies only to payments that do not reach a terminal state<br>(COMPLETED, CANCELED, or FAILED) before the `delay_duration` time period.<br><br>This parameter should be specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format, with a minimum value<br>of 1 minute.<br><br>Note: This feature is only supported for card payments. This parameter can only be set for a delayed<br>capture payment (`autocomplete=false`).<br><br>Default:<br><br>- Card-present payments: "PT36H" (36 hours) from the creation time.<br>- Card-not-present payments: "P7D" (7 days) from the creation time. | getDelayDuration(): ?string | setDelayDuration(?string delayDuration): void |
| `autocomplete` | `?bool` | Optional | If set to `true`, this payment will be completed when possible. If<br>set to `false`, this payment is held in an approved state until either<br>explicitly completed (captured) or canceled (voided). For more information, see<br>[Delayed capture](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments/card-payments#delayed-capture-of-a-card-payment).<br><br>Default: true | getAutocomplete(): ?bool | setAutocomplete(?bool autocomplete): void |
| `orderId` | `?string` | Optional | Associates a previously created order with this payment. | getOrderId(): ?string | setOrderId(?string orderId): void |
| `customerId` | `?string` | Optional | The [Customer](/doc/models/customer.md) ID of the customer associated with the payment.<br><br>This is required if the `source_id` refers to a card on file created using the Customers API. | getCustomerId(): ?string | setCustomerId(?string customerId): void |
| `locationId` | `?string` | Optional | The location ID to associate with the payment. If not specified, the default location is<br>used. | getLocationId(): ?string | setLocationId(?string locationId): void |
| `referenceId` | `?string` | Optional | A user-defined ID to associate with the payment.<br><br>You can use this field to associate the payment to an entity in an external system<br>(for example, you might specify an order ID that is generated by a third-party shopping cart).<br><br>Limit 40 characters.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `40` | getReferenceId(): ?string | setReferenceId(?string referenceId): void |
| `verificationToken` | `?string` | Optional | An identifying token generated by [payments.verifyBuyer()](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/Payments#Payments.verifyBuyer).<br>Verification tokens encapsulate customer device information and 3-D Secure<br>challenge results to indicate that Square has verified the buyer identity.<br><br>For more information, see [SCA Overview](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sca-overview). | getVerificationToken(): ?string | setVerificationToken(?string verificationToken): void |
| `acceptPartialAuthorization` | `?bool` | Optional | If set to `true` and charging a Square Gift Card, a payment might be returned with<br>`amount_money` equal to less than what was requested. For example, a request for $20 when charging<br>a Square Gift Card with a balance of $5 results in an APPROVED payment of $5. You might choose<br>to prompt the buyer for an additional payment to cover the remainder or cancel the Gift Card<br>payment. This field cannot be `true` when `autocomplete = true`.<br><br>For more information, see<br>[Partial amount with Square Gift Cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments#partial-payment-gift-card).<br><br>Default: false | getAcceptPartialAuthorization(): ?bool | setAcceptPartialAuthorization(?bool acceptPartialAuthorization): void |
| `buyerEmailAddress` | `?string` | Optional | The buyer's email address.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `255` | getBuyerEmailAddress(): ?string | setBuyerEmailAddress(?string buyerEmailAddress): void |
| `billingAddress` | [`?Address`](/doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a postal address in a country. The address format is based<br>on an [open-source library from Google](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput). For more information,<br>see [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).<br>This format has dedicated fields for four address components: postal code,<br>locality (city), administrative district (state, prefecture, or province), and<br>sublocality (town or village). These components have dedicated fields in the<br>`Address` object because software sometimes behaves differently based on them.<br>For example, sales tax software may charge different amounts of sales tax<br>based on the postal code, and some software is only available in<br>certain states due to compliance reasons.<br><br>For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the<br>`address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.<br>These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have<br>too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse<br>these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.<br><br>Note that, in the current implementation, all other `Address` type fields are blank.<br>These include `address_line_3`, `sublocality_2`, `sublocality_3`,<br>`administrative_district_level_2`, `administrative_district_level_3`,<br>`first_name`, `last_name`, and `organization`.<br><br>When it comes to localization, the seller's language preferences<br>(see [Language preferences](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api#location-specific-and-seller-level-language-preferences))<br>are ignored for addresses. Even though Square products (such as Square Point of Sale<br>and the Seller Dashboard) mostly use a seller's language preference in<br>communication, when it comes to addresses, they will use English for a US address,<br>Japanese for an address in Japan, and so on. | getBillingAddress(): ?Address | setBillingAddress(?Address billingAddress): void |
| `shippingAddress` | [`?Address`](/doc/models/address.md) | Optional | Represents a postal address in a country.

| `note` | `?string` | Optional | An optional note to be entered by the developer when creating a payment.<br><br>Limit 500 characters.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `500` | getNote(): ?string | setNote(?string note): void |
| `statementDescriptionIdentifier` | `?string` | Optional | Optional additional payment information to include on the customer's card statement<br>as part of the statement description. This can be, for example, an invoice number, ticket number,<br>or short description that uniquely identifies the purchase.<br><br>Note that the `statement_description_identifier` might get truncated on the statement description<br>to fit the required information including the Square identifier (SQ *) and name of the<br>seller taking the payment.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `20` | getStatementDescriptionIdentifier(): ?string | setStatementDescriptionIdentifier(?string statementDescriptionIdentifier): void |
