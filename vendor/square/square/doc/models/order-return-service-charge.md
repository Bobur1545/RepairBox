| `calculationPhase` | [`?string (OrderServiceChargeCalculationPhase)`](/doc/models/order-service-charge-calculation-phase.md) | Optional | Represents a phase in the process of calculating order totals.<br>Service charges are applied after the indicated phase.<br><br>[Read more about how order totals are calculated.](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/how-it-works#how-totals-are-calculated) | getCalculationPhase(): ?string | setCalculationPhase(?string calculationPhase): void |
| `taxable` | `?bool` | Optional | Indicates whether the surcharge can be taxed. Service charges<br>calculated in the `TOTAL_PHASE` cannot be marked as taxable. | getTaxable(): ?bool | setTaxable(?bool taxable): void |

On reads, the applied amount is<br>populated. | getAppliedTaxes(): ?array | setAppliedTaxes(?array appliedTaxes): void |
