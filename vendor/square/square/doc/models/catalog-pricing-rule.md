| `applyProductsId` | `?string` | Optional | __Deprecated__: Please use the `exclude_products_id` field to apply<br>an exclude set instead. Exclude sets allow better control over quantity<br>ranges and offer more flexibility for which matched items receive a discount.<br><br>`CatalogProductSet` to apply the pricing to.<br>An apply rule matches within the subset of the cart that fits the match rules (the match set).<br>An apply rule can only match once in the match set.<br>If not supplied, the pricing will be applied to all products in the match set.<br>Other products retain their base price, or a price generated by other rules. | getApplyProductsId(): ?string | setApplyProductsId(?string applyProductsId): void |
| `excludeProductsId` | `?string` | Optional | `CatalogProductSet` to exclude from the pricing rule.<br>An exclude rule matches within the subset of the cart that fits the match rules (the match set).<br>An exclude rule can only match once in the match set.<br>If not supplied, the pricing will be applied to all products in the match set.<br>Other products retain their base price, or a price generated by other rules. | getExcludeProductsId(): ?string | setExcludeProductsId(?string excludeProductsId): void |
| `validFromDate` | `?string` | Optional | Represents the date the Pricing Rule is valid from. Represented in RFC 3339 full-date format (YYYY-MM-DD). | getValidFromDate(): ?string | setValidFromDate(?string validFromDate): void |

| `excludeStrategy` | [`?string (ExcludeStrategy)`](/doc/models/exclude-strategy.md) | Optional | Indicates which products matched by a CatalogPricingRule<br>will be excluded if the pricing rule uses an exclude set. | getExcludeStrategy(): ?string | setExcludeStrategy(?string excludeStrategy): void |
| `customerGroupIdsAny` | `?(string[])` | Optional | A list of IDs of customer groups, the members of which are eligible for discounts specified in this pricing rule.<br>Notice that a group ID is generated by the Customers API.<br>If this field is not set, the specified discount applies to matched products sold to anyone whether the buyer<br>has a customer profile created or not. If this `customer_group_ids_any` field is set, the specified discount<br>applies only to matched products sold to customers belonging to the specified customer groups. | getCustomerGroupIdsAny(): ?array | setCustomerGroupIdsAny(?array customerGroupIdsAny): void |
