     * For the remaining address components, the `Address` type provides the
     * `address_line_1` and `address_line_2` fields for free-form data entry.
     * These fields are free-form because the remaining address components have
     * too many variations around the world and typical software does not parse
     * these components. These fields enable users to enter anything they want.
